To do this, you can use the following syntax:\n```python\nfrom filename import *\n```\nReplace \"filename\" with the actual name of the file you want to import functions from. This will import all named functions from that file into your current module. However, it's generally not recommended to import all functions from a file at once, as it can make your code less readable and maintainable. It's usually better to import only the functions you actually need."}
