He has worked on integrating multiple relational data from text, images, and time patterns using metapath-aware and relation-aware hashing techniques. His research aims to build efficient similarity searching algorithms and recommenders that are both interpretable and scalable across multiple modalities."

Since \\( M = (i_1j_1...k_{x-1}l_1, i_{x+1}j_{x+1}...i_yl_y) \\), where \\( x + y < n \\), we can represent it as a vector of length \\( n \\).\n\n1. **Node Types**: Each node type \\( i_j, j = 1,..., k_x \\) represents an action or property of the graph.\n2. **Edges**: The edges between these nodes form the metapath \\( M \\), so they are represented as a series of actions in the vector. Specifically, if there are \\( i_j \\) actions per node type, the total number of edges will be \\( i_j \\times k_x \\).\n3. **Nodes**: To ensure consistency with the original problem, each node type should correspond to a unique node index. We can map each node type to a unique index \\( i_i \\), representing the node within the graph.\n\nThe representation of \\( M \\) as a vector would look something like:\n\n\\[ \nv = (i_j, j = 1,..., k_x"
