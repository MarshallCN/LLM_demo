It uses a transformer architecture and is trained on a vast amount of text data to generate human-like text. GPT can be fine-tuned on specific tasks, such as language translation or text summarization, and has shown impressive performance on these tasks.\n\nGPT is built using a combination of deep learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It uses a transformer architecture, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that has been shown to be highly effective for NLP tasks. GPT is also pre-trained on a large dataset of text, which allows it to learn useful patterns and relationships in the data.\n\nOne of the key features of GPT is its ability to generate new text based on a prompt. For example, if you give GPT a sentence, it can generate a continuation of the sentence that makes sense grammatically. This makes GPT a powerful tool for tasks such as language translation and text generation.\n\nOverall, GPT is a highly capable language model that has shown impressive performance on a variety of NLP tasks.
